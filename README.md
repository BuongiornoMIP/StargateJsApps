# StargateJsApps

StargateJS hybridization library for HTML5 apps

# Introduction

StargateJsApps is an hybridization library for hosted apps built around ManifoldJS approach to hybrid application.

Hosted apps are hybrid application that have their files served remotely by a web server and that are described by a manifest (W3C specification)

ManifoldJS is Cordova plugin developed by Microsoft that inject all Cordova dependency after the page is loaded, decoupling the native platform implementation with the web app.

StargateJsApps take advantage of the manifest to store it's configuration, like features to enable or remote api information.
